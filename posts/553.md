<html><body><p>For the straight line challenge, we had a problem, not all of our wheels were equal in speed, meaning that sometimes our rover would slowly drift to one side when instructed to go straight. Calibration helped a bit, but it was hard to be exact. So we came up with a plan, to use the gyroscope to measure how much this drift is. first we tried to make a program that read values from the gyroscope. This took much longer than expected! When we had finally found a way to read the gyroscope, we created a program that drove the rover forward. Simple. Then, it was time to combine the two. We made it so that when it drives forward, it checks to see is it has drifted off to one side with the gyroscope, and corrects itself if necessary. At first, the best idea was to change the speed of the wheels of one side if it goes the other way, but that lead to problems so we had to think of a different solution. Another idea was to turn the wheels to align the rover. This worked a tiny bit better but it still didn't quite work.

The problem was, if the amount it had turned was too big, it would correct itself, bit by bit; this was too slow. What we needed it to do was to turn more if the error was larger and less if it was smaller. The solution was with a PID controller: <b>proportional–integral–derivative controller . </b>This fixed exactly what the problem was.</p></body></html>
